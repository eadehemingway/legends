### features

- basic legend
- gradient legend ( with the ability to add text note, which is stored in local storage and persists if you refresh the page)
- choropleth legend
- timeline legend
- the legends can be reordered using drag and drop (currently only in desktop)

### decisions

- flat file structure
- file names prefaced with their parent...
- styled using styled components
- small components
- typescript
- used react hooks
- used the native DOMParser to parse the html string received from the api

### challenges

- timeline tricky
- drag and drop in mobile (currently not working)
